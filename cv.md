Hello! My name Pavel Glebov.
E-mail: 20Frag08@mail.ru

I am 27 years old. I live in Ryazan, but I come from Irkutsk. Programming was interested in me from school, but did not come directly until the study.
I graduated from Linguistic University in 2010 in the direction of the organization and technology of information protection.
After that, I served in the army for 2 years 8 months. Then I settled to work at the plant in the specialty, a specialist in protecting information.
I want to become a professional in programming, quit the factory, and find my calling.
Itself is not easy to study, so I pass free courses. But I feel that this is not enough.
I hope and believe that I will succeed.

The choice of programming language was very difficult. I stopped on web development.
I studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And I also tried to learn Python.

I have no experience as a programmate.

Higher education. Now I'm focusing on studying javascript.

The level of English is not bad, I can understand the conversation and respond, but without technical terms. Most likely A2+.
