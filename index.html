        I am 27 years old. I live in Ryazan, but I come from Irkutsk. Programming was interested in me from school, but did not come directly until the study. I graduated from Linguistic University in 2010 in the direction of the organization and technology of information protection. After that, I served in the army for 2 years 8 months. Then I settled to work at the plant in the specialty, a specialist in protecting information. I want to become a professional in programming, quit the factory, and find my calling. Itself is not easy to study, so I pass free courses. But I feel that this is not enough. I hope and believe that I will succeed.</p>

        <p>The choice of programming language was very difficult. I stopped on web development. I studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And I also tried to learn Python.</p>

        <p>I have no experience as a programmate.</p>

        <p>Higher education. Now I'm focusing on studying javascript. I want to become a programmer as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>The level of English is not bad, I can understand the conversation and respond, but without technical terms. Most likely A2+.</p>
